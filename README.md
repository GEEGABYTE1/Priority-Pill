# Patient Database 🩺


# Information

A Patient Database that prioritizes patients based on their medical needs and issues 🩺

This software prioritizes patients based on values that have been defined by the user itself based on their medical attention. Without the use of a machine learning model, the priority queue does the priotizing.

Since the user can make up the priority value based on the medical issue, this software is a great example to simulate automation in the healthcare industry. Since the priority queue only cares about the values, no matter what value you put in based on ANY medical issue, the priority queue will always output the patients based on their medical issues. 


# How the software rates medical issues
Based on any *natural* number. For the software to output a proper list of patients based on medical issues, the user themselves must evaluate the medical issue ranging from any natural number. The ratings must be reasonable (for ex, `heart attack: 4` and `headache: 2`), otherwise, the software may output a queue that might have the order messed up.

- `The higher the rating` = The More Dangerous 
- `The lower the rating` = Less Serious 



# Extras

Typing must be accurate in this software. For example, `"Headache"` must be written as `"Headache"` and not `"headache"`, otherwise the software will through an error.

*Controls* are going to be listed when the software is launched.
